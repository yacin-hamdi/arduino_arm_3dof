# Arduino Arm 3DOF

 this repo contain two arduino program:
 - the first is to control arduino robot arm servos angle using potentionmeter
 - the second is implementation of inverse kinematics which is converting the desired end effector position (x, y) coordinate to servos angle, the position is also controlled with potentiometer
